## Abstract

Food insecurity among college students is an pendemic that impacts academics. The purpose of this cross-sectional pilot study was to create a tool that identifies the impact of CalFresh’s perception of the impact using basic needs resources on health, nutrition, cooking confidence, time management and academic performance among 109 Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) students. Using Chi-square and Fisher’s exact test, this study found a positive relationship between students who reported CalFresh participation.
